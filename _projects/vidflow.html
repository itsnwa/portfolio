  <p>vidFlow, the world’s first music video service with
licenses from Universal, Sony and Warner Music,
tailors videos to your preferences - making music
video consumption and discovery easier than ever,
all while contributing directly to the artists.</p>
<p>Since the demise of traditional music TV,
consumers have been left with the task and
responsibility of scanning through a myriad of
sources and filtering out irrelevant content, in
order to re-discover old and discover
new music videos suiting their mood
and preferences at the given time.</p>
<p>Just testing</p>
