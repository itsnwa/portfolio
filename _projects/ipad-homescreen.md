The first time Apple presented the new iPad pro with the huge screen and pencil, I wanted it right away, not because I need to have everything Apple (maybe, partly because of that too..), but because how the pencil worked and the low latency. The reason I did this homescreen project was that I really don't like how the as-is homescreen is just a scaled up version of iOS' homescreen. The fact that this product is aimed at professionals and also creatives, it makes so much sense to have the homescreen more personalized and stylish.

Set your personal work as your wallpaper, add custom widgets that's connected to your workflow, like calendar, inspiration source, todo list etc..

Thank you for watching <3
